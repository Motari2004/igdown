## 💎 Exclusive Features

### 🛠️ Anti-Sleep Heartbeat
Optimized for **Render** and **Heroku** deployments. Scorpio includes an automated background task that pings the system `/health` endpoint every 10 minutes, effectively bypassing the 15-minute inactivity "idle sleep" on free-tier hosting.

### 🧬 System Recalibration
Upon every initialization or manual refresh, the engine executes a protocol to clear the data gateway and reset the extraction pipeline. This ensures a 100% optimized state for every new request.

### ⏱️ 6-Second Auto-Reset
To maintain maximum system reliability, Scorpio features an automated session reset. After a fetch execution, the system performs a hard reset of the interface exactly **6 seconds** later, preventing memory leaks and ensuring the extraction engine remains primed for high-speed use.
